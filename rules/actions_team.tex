\subsubsection{Teamwork}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  If characters can work together on an action, a second character can add half their score, a third adds a quarter, and so on.

  Always round up the final score.
  \item
  If characters cannot work together, roll the dice once, and everyone uses that result to calculate their own final score.
\end{itemize}
