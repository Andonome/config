\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Players roll Speed + Projectiles against \gls{tn} 6 to hit stationary targets.
  \item
  Every 5 steps adds +1 to the \gls{tn}.
  \item
  When a player hits the \gls{tn} precisely, they miss their first target, but hit any other target behind.
  \item
  Spending 1 \gls{ap} lets targets resist with Speed + Vigilance.
\end{itemize}
