use \roll{Dexterity}{Projectiles}, targets resist with \roll{Speed}{Vigilance}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Every 5 \glspl{step}' distance adds +1 to the \gls{tn}.
  \item
  When \pgls{pc} hits the \gls{tn} precisely, they miss their first target, but hit another target behind (if any).
\end{itemize}
