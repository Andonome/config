\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Players roll \roll{Dexterity}{Projectiles} against \gls{tn} 6 to hit stationary targets.
  \item
  Every 5 steps adds +1 to the \gls{tn}.
  \item
  When a player hits the \gls{tn} precisely, they miss their first target, but hit another target behind (if any).
  \item
  Targets can spend \pgls{ap} to resist with \roll{Speed}{Vigilance}.
\end{itemize}
