\subsection*{Projectiles}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Players roll Dexterity + Projectiles against TN 5 to hit stationary targets.
  \item
  Every 5 steps adds +1 to the TN.
  \item
  Moving targets increase the TN with their Speed + Athletics total.
  \item
  When a player hits the TN precisely, they miss their first target, but any other target behind.
\end{itemize}
