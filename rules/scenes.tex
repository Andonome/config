At the end of each scene, a number of things happen:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The \gls{gm} rolls 1D6, and every character who took part in the scene regenerates that many \glspl{fp}.
  \item
  Characters who rested for the scene regenerate a number of Fatigue Points equal to half their current \glspl{hp} (rounded up).
  \item
  Characters regenerate 3 \glspl{mp} from the surrounding air.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    +1 \gls{mp} in stormy weather.
    \item
    -1 \gls{mp} for wearing partial armour or equivalent covering.
    \item
    -2 \glspl{mp} for wearing complete armour or equivalent covering.
    \item
    -1 \gls{mp} for staying indoors or underground.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
