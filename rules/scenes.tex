At the end of each scene, a number of things happen:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The \gls{gm} rolls 1D6, and every character who took part in the scene regenerates that many \glspl{fp}.
  \item
  Characters who rested for the scene regenerate a number of Fatigue Points equal to half their current \glspl{hp} (rounded up).
  \item
  The \gls{gm} divides a number of \glspl{mp} between everything in the area which can hold \glspl{mp} (round up).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \Glspl{mp} comes in the wind, so windy locations allow faster regeneration.

    \hline
    Underground & 1 \\
    Indoors     & 2 \\
    Outdoors    & 3 \\
    Storm       & 4 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \item
    Anything with \glspl{mp} then receives penalties for shielding their bodies against the air.

    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{Xc}
    \hline
    Partial armour  & -1 \\
    Complete armour & -2 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \item
    Equivalent heavy clothing provides the same penalties.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
