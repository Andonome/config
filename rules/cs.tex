When handing out the premade character sheets, hand out the characters one at a time, to the player on your left.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Take the top character and give a brief overview.
  \item
  Hand it to the player on your left.
  They can either accept the character, or pass it to the next player.
  \item
  If a character returns to you, put it back in the \gls{characterPool}, at the bottom of the pile.
  \item
  If \pgls{pc} dies, the player selects another character from this pool.
  \item
  Any allies which enter the game become part of this pool.
\end{itemize}
