\subsubsection*{Dangerous \& Difficult Actions}

Roll the dice to determine the state of the world.
The dice roll remains fixed, so anyone attempting the same action receives the same result.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  The \gls{gm} states the \gls{tn}:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    7 for difficult actions,
    \item
    12 for professional actions,
    \item
    16 for extreme.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  The player rolls 2D6, and adds:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Attribute Bonus,
    \item
    Skill Bonus,
    \item
    Equipment Bonus.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  The \gls{gm} interprets the results:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    If the roll exceeds the \gls{tn}, the action was a success.
    \item
    If the roll falls below the \gls{tn}, the action fails, and the danger occurs.
    \item
    If the roll equals the \gls{tn}, the result is a \emph{tie}.
    If success and failure conditions could occur at the same time, the character may choose to accept both, or neither.
    Otherwise, the result is a partial success.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
