\subsubsection*{Fate}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Every character can store a number of \glspl{fp} equal to the number of knacks they have, times four.
  \item
  If the character would receive Damage, they can elect to lose \glspl{fp} instead.
  \item
  At the end of each scene, the \gls{gm} rolls 1D6, and every character who took part in the scene regenerates that many \glspl{fp}.
\end{itemize}
