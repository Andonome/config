Everything in the game has \pgls{weight}, and when characters carry more than they should, each point inflicts a Penalty to all actions.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Characters can hold a total \gls{weight} equal to their current \glspl{hp} without Penalty.

  \hint{Characters can carry a total \gls{weight} equal to half their \glspl{hp} in their arms.}
  \hint{Someone with 8~\glspl{hp} who picks up a bronze statue, with \gls{weight}~12 would receive a -8~Penalty to all actions.
  Mounting it on their back reduces the Penalty to~-4.}

  \hint{Using only one hand puts the limit to a quarter of their \glspl{hp}.}
  \hint{If \pgls{pc} with 6~\glspl{hp} lifts a poleaxe with \gls{weight}~4, they would receive a -2 Penalty}

  \item
  All creatures have \pgls{weight} equal to their \glspl{hp}.
  \item
  At the end of any strenuous activity, characters gain \pgls{ep}, which counts as having \pgls{weight} of~1.

  \hint{This includes combat, marching, or going without sleep.}
\end{itemize}
