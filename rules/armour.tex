Armour reduces Damage, but only covers some parts of the body.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Armour removes an amount of Damage equal to its \gls{dr}.
  \item
  If an attack roll equals the \gls{tn} minus the armour's \gls{covering}, then the armour does not help; i.e. the opponent has scored a \gls{vitalShot}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
  Most armour has a \gls{covering} of `3', meaning that it covers most of the body (but not all) and only covers 3 steps of the dice.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  If you roll equal to the \gls{tn} plus the opponent's \gls{covering}, then you have scored a \gls{vitalShot}, and you can ignore the opponent's \gls{dr} when dealing Damage.
\end{itemize}
