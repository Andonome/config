Armour provides \gls{dr}, which can protect against Damage, but only covers a few numbers on the dice.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \Glspl{pc} armour usually covers two steps of dice, so when \glspl{pc} miss by only 1 or 2 steps, they can reduce Damage by the armour's \gls{dr}.
  \item
  If they miss an attack roll by 3 or more, the armour does nothing, and they receive a \textit{Vitals Shot}.
  \item
  Similarly, \glspl{pc} rolling over an opponent's Attack score, and \emph{then} above their armour's \textit{Covering}, ignore all \gls{dr} as their weapon finds bare flesh.
  \item
  Full armour can provide more covering.
\end{itemize}
