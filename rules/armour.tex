Armour reduces Damage, but only covers some parts of the body.
Most armour has a \gls{covering} of `3', meaning that it covers most of the body (but not all).

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  If you roll below or equal to the \gls{tn} minus your \gls{covering}, the opponent scores a \gls{vitalShot}, and ignores your Armour dealing full Damage.
  \item
  If you roll below the \gls{tn}, the opponent hits, and your Armour reduces the Damage by its \gls{dr}.
  \item
  If you roll above the \gls{tn}, you hit, and the opponent's Armour reduces the Damage by its \gls{dr}.
  \item
  If you roll equal to or above the \gls{tn} plus the opponent's \gls{covering}, you score a \gls{vitalShot}, and ignore the opponent's Armour dealing full Damage.
\end{itemize}
