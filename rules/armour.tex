\subsubsection*{Armour}

Armour provides \gls{dr}, which can protect against Damage, but only if the \gls{pc} rolls high enough.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  If \glspl{pc} fail an Attack roll by a number equal to the armour's Covering, the attack is a \textit{Vitals Shot}, and the armour provides no \gls{dr}.
  \index{Vitals Shot}
  \item
  When attack rolls fail by a number less than the armour's Covering, the Damage is reduced by the armour's \gls{dr}.
  \item
  When \glspl{pc} succeed in an Attack roll by \emph{more} than their opponent's Covering, they inflict a Vitals Shot, and ignore the opponent's \gls{dr}.
\end{itemize}
