\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{interval}}
\label{intervals}
divide the day into four parts.

\begin{boxtable}[c|c|Y|Y]

  \hline
  \showInterval{1} & \showInterval{2} & \showInterval{2} & \showInterval{2} \\ 
  \textbf{Morning} & \textbf{Afternoon} & \textbf{Evening} & \textbf{Night} \\
  \hline
\end{boxtable}

At the end of each \gls{interval}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The \gls{gm} rolls $1D6$, and every character who took part in the \gls{interval} regenerates that many \glspl{fp}.
  \item
  Resting characters remove \pgls{ep}.
  \item
  The \gls{gm} divides a number of \glspl{mp} between everything in the area which can hold \glspl{mp}.
\end{itemize}

\manaRegenChart

The wind brings \glspl{mp}, so windy locations allow faster \gls{mp} regeneration.

Anyone absorbing \glspl{mp} receives penalties for shielding their bodies against the air.

Equivalent heavy clothing provides the same penalties.
