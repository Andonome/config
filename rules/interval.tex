The day has four \glspl{interval}:

\noindent
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{c|c|c|Y}

  \hline
  1 \textbf{Morning} & 2 \textbf{Afternoon} & 3 \textbf{Evening} & 4 \textbf{Night} \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
\vspace{.3em}

At the end of each \gls{interval}, a number of things happen:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The \gls{gm} rolls 1D6, and every character who took part in the \gls{interval} regenerates that many \glspl{fp}.
  \item
  Resting characters remove \pgls{ep}.
  \item
  The \gls{gm} divides a number of \glspl{mp} between everything in the area which can hold \glspl{mp} (round up).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      The wind brings \glspl{mp}, so windy locations allow faster \gls{mp} regeneration.

    \manaRegenChart
    \item
    Anyone absorbing \glspl{mp} receives penalties for shielding their bodies against the air.

    \manaCoveringChart
    \item
    Equivalent heavy clothing provides the same penalties.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
