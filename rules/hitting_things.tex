\subsubsection{Combat}
starts and everyone takes 3 + Speed \glspl{ap}.
You can go in any order, but those with more \glspl{ap} can interrupt and go first (faster actions break ties).

\paragraph{You attack}
with \roll{Dexterity}{Combat}, winner deals Damage equal to $1D6$ + Strength (+4 Damage becomes $1D6$).

\paragraph{Resistance is mandatory}
-- spend \glspl{ap} to attack, cast, or run.

Anyone with negative \glspl{ap} takes that as a Penalty.
\hint{Once on -3~\glspl{ap}, you take a -3 Penalty to all actions}

\paragraph{You move}
3~\glspl{step} + Athletics (cost: 1~\gls{ap}).
When avoiding attacks, roll \roll{Speed}{Athletics}.

\begin{boxtable}
  1 & shunt someone back with \roll{Dexterity}{Brawl} \\
  1 & guard a friend -- attacks must go through you \\
  1 & draw weapon \\
  3 & use item \\
\end{boxtable}
