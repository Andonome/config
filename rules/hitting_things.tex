\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Each character sets their \glspl{ap} to 3 + Speed.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Attacking someone requires a Resisted \roll{Dexterity}{Combat} roll, and costs \pgls{ap}.
    The winner deals 1D6 Damage.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item
      When someone attacks you, you must still spend \glspl{ap}, even if you have none.
      \item
      Anyone with negative \glspl{ap} takes that as a penalty.
      \hint{Being attacked with -3~\glspl{ap} means you take a -3 penalty}
    \end{itemize}
    \item
    Movement costs 1 \gls{ap} and allows people to move 3 \glspl{step} + their Athletics Bonus.
    To flee requires a resisted roll of \roll{Speed}{Athletics}.
    \item
    Guarding someone costs 1 \gls{ap}.
    Anyone attacking the target must successfully attack you first (without dealing Damage).
    They can then spend \glspl{ap} to attack the target immediately.
    \item
    Ramming or pushing costs 1~\gls{ap} (\roll{Dexterity}{Brawl}).
    \item
    Drawing a weapon costs 1~\gls{ap}.
    \item
    Using items (such as drinking potions or reading books) costs 3~\glspl{ap}.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  Circle round the table, with each player taking their turn.
  However, if any character wants to jump in, use this order:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The character who has the most \glspl{ap} goes first.
    \item
    The character doing the action which requires the least \glspl{ap} to spend.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
