\subsubsection{Combat}
needs a coin to track your \glspl{ap}.
Start each round with 3 + Speed.
You act in any order, but those with more \glspl{ap} can interrupt (shorter actions break ties).

\begin{description}
  \item[You attack]
with \roll{Dexterity}{Combat}, winner deals Damage equal to $1D6$ + Strength (+4 Damage becomes $1D6$).

\item[Resistance is mandatory]
so spend \glspl{ap} to attack, cast, or run, even if your \glspl{ap} fall below 0.

\item[Below 0~\glspl{ap}]
your only actions are responses, while the deficit becomes a Penalty.
