demand \glspl{mp}, or inflict \glspl{ep}.
Once cast, they jump out, and fork through the nearest targets like lightning.
The caster can only decide the first target, and can only limit the range by \glspl{step}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The player rolls Charisma plus the \emph{lowest} Sphere the spell requires.
  \item
  Spells resisted by another's roll can stop a physical attack.
  \item
  Spells endure until they stop.
  Fire spells last until the fire dies.
  If a witch makes antlers grow from your head, only a boning-knife can `dispel' them.
\end{itemize}
