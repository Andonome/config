\subsubsection*{Spells}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  To cast a spell, roll Charisma plus the \emph{lowest} Sphere which the spell requires.
  \item
  The spell's level is the \gls{mp} cost, and the \gls{mp} cost is the level.
  \item
  The \gls{tn} depends on the target.
  The target determines the spell's \gls{tn}.
  Hard rocks resist shattering, and small rivers will not flood easily.
  \item
  Casters without \glspl{mp} lose \glspl{ep} instead.
  \item
  Spells cannot reduce their range by too many \glspl{step}.
  Spells cannot target something too far below their range.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \textit{Spells targeting `a stone's throw away' cannot target someone next to the caster.}
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  Spells have no duration -- they vanish once someone interferes with the spell's results.
\end{itemize}
