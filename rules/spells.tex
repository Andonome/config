\subsubsection*{Spells}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  To cast a spell, roll Charisma plus the Sphere used to cast the spell.
  \item
  The spell's level is the \gls{mp} cost, and the \gls{mp} cost is the level.
  \item
  The target determines the spell's \gls{tn}.
  Hard rocks resist shattering, and small rivers will not flood easily.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    When spells affect a creature, the creature may also resist by dodging rocks, or ignoring mental suggestions from the Mind Sphere, et c.
    \item
    If the spell has two \glspl{tn}, the highest applies, then half of the second-highest, and so on.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  Casters without \glspl{mp} lose \glspl{fatigue} instead.
  \item
  Spells cannot target something too far below their range.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Spells which target something a few steps away can target anything, even within touching distance.
    \item
    Spells which target something 'a stone's throw' away cannot target anything nearby.
    Spells which target within shouting distance cannot affect anything within a stone's throw, and so on.
  \end{itemize}
