\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The caster spends the required \glspl{mp}.
  Casters without \glspl{mp} gain \glspl{ep} instead.
  \item
  The caster's player rolls Charisma plus the \emph{lowest} Sphere the spell requires.
  \item
  The \gls{tn} depends on the target.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Earth spells resisted by `rock density' have \tn[7] to affect snow, 14 for slate, and 16 for iron.
    \item
    Spells resisted by `\roll{Intelligence}{Academics}' set the \gls{tn} to 7, plus the opponent's stats.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  Casters cannot stifle nor banish spells.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Spells with an area of 27 targets at `\textit{throwing distance}', cannot target anything closer -- they begin at that distance, and arc across the nearest 27 targets like lightning through flesh.
    \item
    To dispel a rampaging fire, put it out; and to banish antlers, cut them off with a boning knife.
  \end{itemize}
