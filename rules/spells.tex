\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The caster spends the required \glspl{mp}.
  Casters without \glspl{mp} gain \glspl{ep} instead.
  \item
  The player rolls Charisma plus the \emph{lowest} Sphere the spell requires.
  \item
  The \gls{tn} depends on the target.

  \hint{Earth spells resisted by `rock density' have \tn[7] to affect snow, 14 for slate, and 16 for iron.}

  \par
  \hint{Spells resisted by `\roll{Intelligence}{Academics}' set the \gls{tn} to 7, plus the opponent's stats.}

  \item
  Casters cannot stifle nor banish spells.

  \hint{Spells with an area of 27 targets at `throwing distance', cannot target anything closer -- they begin at that distance, and arc across the nearest 27 targets like lightning through flesh.}

  \par
  \hint{To dispel a rampaging fire, put it out; and to banish antlers, cut them off with a boning knife.}
