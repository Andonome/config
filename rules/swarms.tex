are myriad, small creatures, acting as one.
They crawl over characters, and into gaps in armour.

\begin{itemize}

  \item
  Swarms can pull together to bunch up on a single \gls{step}, or spread across a number of \glspl{step} equal to their \glspl{hp}.
  \item
  Swarms can split, then rejoin, as part of a normal movement action.
  \item
  The \gls{tn} to attack a swarm equals a variable minus the swarm's current \glspl{hp}.
  (When you encounters a sea of rats, it's hard to miss all of them!)
  \item
  A successful attack inflicts 1 Damage to the swarm, as the character crushes most of the creatures on them or next to them.
  \item
  The swarm inflicts 1 fixed Damage to everyone it occupies an area with.
  \item
  If the swarm has more \glspl{hp} than any armour's \gls{covering}, the swarm ignores \gls{dr}.
\end{itemize}
