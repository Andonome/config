\subsubsection{Banding}
Bonuses together lets you add half of the second, a quarter of the third, and so on
(round halves up).

%\hint{Two \glspl{pc} search \pgls{village} for anything with their family's crest.
%The first has a +4 Bonus, the other has +3.
%Think ``$4 + \frac{3}{2} = 5\frac{1}{2} = 6$'', so they make a single roll with a +6 Bonus}
