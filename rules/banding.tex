\subsubsection{Banding}
Bonuses together lets you add half of the second, a quarter of the third, and so on
(round halves up).
\hint{\Pgls{pc} searches the empty \gls{village} with a +4 Bonus.
Her companion helps, with his +3 Bonus.
$4 + \frac{3}{2} = 5\frac{1}{2} = 6$, so they roll with a +6 Bonus}

Use this system for teamwork, layering spells, or anything else which affects Bonuses and Penalties.
