\subsubsection{Banding}

When characters can work together, they band their Bonuses together.
The highest Bonus counts in full, the second counts for half, the third for a quarter, and so on.
Halves round up.
\hint{\Pgls{pc} searches the empty \gls{village} with a +4 Bonus.
Her companion helps, with his +3 Bonus.
$4 + \frac{3}{2} = 5\frac{1}{2} = 6$, so they roll with a +6 Bonus}
