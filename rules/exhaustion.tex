  \item
  Every strenuous activity inflicts one \gls{ep}.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item
    Marching through a mile of forest.
    \item
    Marching along two miles of road.
    \item
    Combat.
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  Every \gls{ep} a character has above their current \glspl{hp} inflicts a -1 penalty to all actions.
  \item
  Characters only receive \glspl{ep} \emph{after} they stop the activity.
\end{itemize}
