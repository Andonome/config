  {\spellArea\ people or plants cool so much that they freeze nearby water}% Description
  {
    All \spellArea\ targets start feeling chilly, then freezing, and eventually settle into their new `normal'.
    They feel comfortably cold at all times, and even freeze nearby water.
    They cannot drink, but can still nourish themselves by eating ice.

    A total of \spellArea\ barrels' worth of liquid in the vicinity freezes over (meaning one per target).
    The spell can dramatically affect rivers, and any unfortunate taverns nearby.
    Rain presents even more serious problems to everyone around, including those afflicted by the spell.

    Each target effectively has a repeating spell of frost cast from their body.
    If they ever split up, each one will convert a single \gls{mp} in the area to this freezing effect.
    Of course, while together, the group will suck all \glspl{mp} from the surrounding air, but the spell continues, whether or not it has any \glspl{mp}.

    Once this aura runs dry for too long, the spell ends.
    Just like any person, the spell itself gains \glspl{fatigue} when no \glspl{mp} are present in the air, and once the \gls{fatigue} penalty reaches -5, the spell `dies'.
