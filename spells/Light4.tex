  {\arabic{spellCost} targets in the distance receive chimerical copies}% Description
  {
    The caster sings encouraging songs to one side of a distant fight, and one side receives chimerical copies of themselves.

    The copies split from their real selves like dough being torn apart, so anyone watching this process will find it very difficult to tell which of the enemies they can see presents a real danger.
