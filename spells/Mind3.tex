  {\spellArea\ targets \spellRange\ away suffer -\arabic{spelllevel}~\glspl{ap}}% Description
  {
    The caster waves to people in the distance and calls out a confusing greeting.
    It makes no sense, and confusion begins to take hold.
    \spellArea\ targets within \spellRange\ become disoriented, and suffer a minus \arabic{spelllevel} penalty to all actions based on Mental Attributes.
    Any target in combat loses the same number of \glspl{ap} each round.

    All valid targets in range feel the effects, so if the spell can only target one enemy, then it will target anyone else until it has affected \spellArea\ targets.
    The spell lasts until the character gains \pgls{xp} for following their Code.
  }
