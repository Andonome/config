  {\arabic{spellTargets} targets \spellRange\ away suffer -\arabic{spellCost}~\glspl{ap}}% Description
  {
    The caster waves to people in the distance and calls out a confusing greeting.
    It makes no sense, and confusion begins to take hold.
    \arabic{spellTargets} targets within \spellRange\ become disoriented, and suffer a minus \arabic{spellCost} penalty to all actions based on Mental Attributes.
    Any target in combat loses the same number of \glspl{ap} each round.

    All valid targets in range feel the effects, so if the spell can only target one enemy, then it will target anyone else until it has affected \arabic{spellTargets} targets.
    The spell lasts until the character gains \pgls{xp} for following their Code.
  }
