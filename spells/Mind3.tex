    The caster waves to people in the distance and calls out a confusing greeting.
    It makes no sense, and confusion begins to take hold.
    The targets become disoriented, and suffer a -\arabic{spellCost} penalty to all actions based on Mental Attributes.

    The spell lasts until the character gains \pgls{xp} for following their Code.
