  {Up to \spellArea\ fires in the area take the form of a ragin, red, bull, dealing \rollConv\ Damage to anyone near them}% Description
  {
    Fires all around flare up, and take on the form of a fiery bull.
    The spell affects \spellArea\ steps in total, and this may represent a series of furnaces in a busy blacksmith's which vomit fires out to form a gigantic bull, or myriad candles during a guild ceremony, which create a stampede of regular-sized bulls.

  Anyone `trampled' by the flames receives \rollConv\ Damage.
  After this, the flames recede to their regular size, but with much less fuel than they started with.
  Furnaces burn through their wood, and candles often burn down to a stump within that long second the spell lasts.
