  {Fires all around flare up, and join together in the form of a burning bull which covers \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{step} and tramples across the caster's enemies in an instant, inflicting \showDam\ Damage}% Description
  {
  The bull begins with \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{ap}, and spends them to move \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{step}.

  The bull burns through an hour's worth of fuel upon creation.
  If it has no more \glspl{ap}, it expires, but if any fuel sources remain, it can end its rampage by rushing towards a fuel source, rekindling one \gls{ap} per \gls{round}.
