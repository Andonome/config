  {the caster increases any force acting on a target, increasing the Damage by \arabic{spellCost}. This requires acting at the same \glspl{ap} level}% Description
  {
    The caster focusses on a moving object, and makes it move faster.
    Anything which hits someone, hits even harder.

    This spell requires excellent timing, as the caster must hold exactly the same \glspl{ap} as whichever action causes the damage.
    For example, when someone aims a bow to strike a bandit, the caster calls to the arrow to fly fast, and it inflicts +1 Damage.

    The caster cannot use this spell to attack directly, as they cannot attack at the same time as casting.
