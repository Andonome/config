    The task always takes the form of a single verb -- `blacksmithing', `walking', `singing' -- never something convoluted like `the mission to kidnap the warden', or `finding the right paints for the colour of a Sunrise'.

    \Glspl{npc} targeted by the spell can make a \roll{Wits}{Academics} roll, \tn[8], to break away from the task.
    \Glspl{pc} afflicted by the spell cannot gain any further \glspl{xp} for the a full day (four \glspl{interval}), unless they complete the current \gls{interval} without wavering from their task.

  Anyone sleeping almost certainly remains asleep, and any rolls to wake up suffer a -\arabic{spellPlusOne} penalty.}
