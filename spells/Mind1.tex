  {The caster complement's someone's work, and they find it hard to stop}% Description
  {The task always takes the form of a single verb -- `blacksmithing', `walking', `singing' -- never something convoluted like `the mission to kidnap the \glsentrytext{warden}', or `finding the right paints for the colour of a Sunrise'.

    Anyone can make a second roll to break from their task, with a +2~Bonus if continuing the task  would lead to serious consequences, and a +4 Bonus if the task has become deadly.
	Once the target breaks from the task, the spell ends.}
