  {Target becomes enamoured with their current action, and finds it hard to stop}% Description
  {
    The task always takes the form of a single verb -- `blacksmithing', `walking', `singing' -- never something convoluted like `the mission to kidnap the warden', or `finding the right paints for the colour of a Sunrise'.

    \Glspl{npc} targeted by the spell can make a \roll{Wits}{Academics} roll, \tn[8], to break away from the task.
    \Glspl{pc} afflicted by the spell cannot gain any further \glspl{xp} for the a full day (four \glspl{interval}), unless they complete the current \gls{interval} without wavering from their task.

  Anyone sleeping almost certainly remains asleep, and rolls to wake up suffer a -4 penalty.}

  {This spell tells the caster if any particular patch (and it has to be a specific patch) contains anything which has a mind}% Description
  {Shadows, statues, or suspicious bushes can all hide all manner of things.

    The spell will not say what kind of mind this is -- whether animal or person.
    It reports only `yes/ no', and often has false positives due to mice or insects (1/6 chance in daylight, 2/6 chance at night).}
