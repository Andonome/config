  {`Disgusting', the caster shouts, and \arabic{spellTargets} barrels' worth of water become acidic (\showDam~Damage per round of total submersion)}% Description
  {
    Armour or clothing of any type can remove an amount of Damage equal to its \gls{covering}, but if the Damage equals the armour's \gls{dr} then the armour degrades and begins to fall apart within \arabic{spellCost} rounds as leather straps and string degrade.

    Fast rivers, or wide waters dissipate the acid and reduce the Damage.
	Splitting it into small receptacles reduces it by even more.
