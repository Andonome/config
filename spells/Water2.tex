  {`Disgusting', the caster shouts, and \arabic{spellTargets} barrels' worth of water become acidic (\arabic{spellCost} Damage per round contact)}% Description
  {
    Armour or clothing of any type can remove an amount of Damage equal to its Covering rating, but if the Damage equals the armour's \gls{dr} then the armour degrades and begins to fall apart within \arabic{spellCost} rounds as leather straps and string degrade.

    Anyone submerged in the liquid takes \addtocounter{spellCost}{2} \dmg{spellCost} Damage per turn.
    Casting this spell in a slow-moving stream can be deadly to a single target.
    However, fast rivers, or casting on a wider area, each reduce the Damage by -1 or more.
