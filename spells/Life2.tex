\spell{Atrophy}% Name
  {duplicated}% Enhancements
  {Wane}% Action

  {current \glspl{hp}}% Resist with
  {the target's Strength or Speed Bonus reduces by \arabic{spelllevel}}% Description
  {
    The caster insults the targets' diminutive build (even if they happen to be tall and strong), and they begin to whither, becoming unevently thin.
    The target takes a minus \arabic{spelllevel} penalty to either Strength or Speed (caster's choice).
    If Strength suffers the penalty, the target may find that they cannot properly carry the weight of their own armour, or weapons.

    The Attribute penalty returns at the same rate as lost \glspl{hp}.

  {target's strangeness}% Resist with
  {the caster detects any life around \spellRange\ away}% Description
  {
    Focussing on the air, and sniffing the wind, the caster asks politely if it will say whether or not some creature sits around \spellRange\ away.

    Other humanoids are \tn[7] to detect, beasts are \tn[9], and stranger creatures present a greater challange.
