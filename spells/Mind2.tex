  {Once the target states their intention, the caster accepts their `oath' with great formality, and the statement becomes an oath and an obsession.
  The target receives a +\arabic{spellPlusOne} Bonus to Mind-based Resting Actions to fulfill their oath, and a -\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Penalty to all Mind-based actions which distract from it}% Description
  {The spell lasts until they complete their oath, or the character gains \pgls{xp} for following their Code.

  For example, if someone boasted that they would kill \pgls{guard} deserter (even sarcastically), \pgls{witch} might respond by saying `I accept this oath, and will from this day forth count you among the greatest of the land's warriors and protectors!'.
  The target would receive a +\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Bonus to planning the best route, or writing to allies to help with the fight, assuming those were both \glspl{restingaction}.
  But if someone asked them to stop and identify \pgls{talisman}, the roll would have a -\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Penalty, because they can only think about killing that deserter.
  Noticing a pick-pocket with \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} has no modifier, because it the \gls{action} doesn't detract from the oath.}
