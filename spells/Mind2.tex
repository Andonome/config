  {Once the target states their intention, the caster accepts their `oath' with great formality, and the statement becomes an oath and an obsession.
  The target receives a +\arabic{spellPlusOne} Bonus to Mind-based Resting Actions to fulfil their oath, and a -\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Penalty to all Mind-based actions which distract from it}% Description
  {The spell lasts until they complete their oath, or the character gains \pgls{xp} for following their Code.

  For example, if someone boasted that they would kill \pgls{guard} deserter (even sarcastically), \pgls{witch} might respond by saying `I accept this oath, and will from this day forth count you among the greatest of the land's warriors and protectors!'.
  The target would receive a +\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Bonus to planning the best route, or writing to allies to help with the fight, assuming those were both \glspl{restingaction}.
  But if someone asked them to stop and identify \pgls{talisman}, the roll would have a -\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Penalty, because they can only think about killing that deserter.
  Noticing a pick-pocket with \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} has no modifier, because the \gls{action} doesn't detract from the oath.

  The target can interpret what they said in any way they please, as long as the meaning remains intelligible.
  Someone who promised to marry an irritating man might arrange to have him marry someone else and perform the ceremony, meaning that she has `married him' (to his bride).}
