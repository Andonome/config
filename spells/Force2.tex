  {a magical portal, connecting two places within \spellRange. Creatures with a \gls{weight} of \arabic{spellArea} or less can fit through}% Description
  {
    A magical doorway appears, connecting two spaces.
    While it may seem that the spell has two targets, in fact it has one, because the two spaces become one.

    These portals degrade over time, since even the wind corrodes the delicate edges.

    Creatures with a \gls{weight} of up to \spellArea\ can fit through the door, but any over that will brush against the side of the delicate edges of the portal, destroying it.
    Anyone with a \gls{weight} 1 point over the portal's maximum can attempt to rush through it with a \roll{Speed}{Athletics} check.
    Success means the creature has gone through before the portal closes, failure will shunt them back with an explosive `pop', inflicting \arabic{spelllevel} \glspl{fatigue}.
