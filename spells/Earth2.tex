  {the caster forms snow or sand into a weapon blade. It shatters if it deals over \arabic{spellPotency} Damage}% Description
  {
    Reaching into some soft ground, such as sand or snow, the caster explains how to form a weapon, and the ground complies.

    The higher the target weapon's \gls{weight}, the more difficult the spell, as the \gls{weight} adds (but never subtracts) from the \gls{tn}.

    The weapons produced have a maximum \gls{weight} of \arabic{spelllevel}, and shatter on a solid blow (anything over \arabic{spellPotency} Damage).
