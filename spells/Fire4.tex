  {
    The caster sings the Festival of Fire song -- an ancient elvish incantation about not being invited to a gathering.
    All fires around \spellRange\ transform into dancing humanoids, spiralling around each other fast enough to tear themselves apart.
    Anyone standing in the way of the dance receives repeated fiery lacerations.

    Anyone hit by the flames takes \showDam\ Damage.
