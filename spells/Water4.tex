  {
  After the initial onslaught, the dioarama's apparitions begin acting like the memories they represent, but with the caster's values.
  A greedy caster will produce apparitions which grab valuables, and a curious caster produces apparitions which spread out, exploring their new world.

  The apparitions' potence reduces by 1 each \gls{round} until they become nothing.}
