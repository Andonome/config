  {With a description of the grey world beyond, the caster pushes the target into a state of semi-death.

  {
    The target can make limited use of their normal vision, but mostly feels aware of the penetrating light given off by every soul.
    Animals emit a feint light.
    Those with a higher Charisma score tend to emanate a little more.

    The vision becomes indistinct beyond \spellRange\ -- the target understands nothing more than `something might live over there', and any life around them quickly distorts that limited vision.

    For as long as the spell remains active, the target cannot regenerate \glspl{ep}, \glspl{mp}, or \glspl{hp}.
    While the spell diminishes a little with every movement, but targets who remain still retain the spell's effects.
    If another spell from the Mind sphere puts the target in a permanent state of sleep, they remain that way, neither growing, nor aging, until some external force moves them.
