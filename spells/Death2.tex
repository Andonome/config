  {Corpses in this state no longer decay\ldots or at least delay any decay for \arabic{spellCost}~\glspl{interval}. 
    Time spent completely motionless does not count against this time, so any corpse can remain indefinitely fresh, and any poison can remain indefinitely at bay, as long as the subject does not move an inch.

  {With a description of the grey world beyond, the caster pushes the target into a state of semi-death.
  They gain \gls{dr} 2, ignore all \gls{fatigue} penalties, and see as the dead see, for \arabic{spellCost}~\glspl{interval}}% Description
  {
    The target can make limited use of their normal vision, but mostly feels aware of the penetrating light given off by every soul.
    Animals emit a feint light.
    Those with a higher Charisma score tend to emanate a little more.

    The vision becomes indistinct beyond \spellRange\ -- the target understands nothing more than `something might live over there', and any life around them quickly distorts that limited vision.

    For as long as the spell remains active, the target cannot regenerate \glspl{fatigue}, \glspl{mp}, or \glspl{hp}.
    While the spell diminishes a little with every movement, but targets who remain still retain the spell's effects.
    If another spell from the Mind sphere puts the target in a permanent state of sleep, they remain that way, neither growing, nor aging, until some external force moves them.
