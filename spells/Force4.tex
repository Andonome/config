  {
    The caster shouts to some group in the distance to sit down, and their bodies begin to feel so heavy they cannot lift themselves.
    The targets take an immediate \arabic{spellCost} \gls{ap} penalty.
    However, they can try to wriggle free of the warping effects of their own weight, by spending \pgls{ap}, or more.
    Each \gls{ap} spent reduces their penalty by 1, so someone with \arabic{spellCost} \glspl{ap} spare could ignore the effects immediately.
