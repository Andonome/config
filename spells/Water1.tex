  {up to a barrel of water turns into mist}% Description
  {
    Some body of liquid -- up to a barrel's worth -- instantly turns to mist, then quickly coalesces, soaking anything in the area.

    Torches struggle to keep aflame as an entire room can become soaked.

    When cast on a mostly-liquid creature, such as oozes, this spell deals \showDam~Damage.
