  {A target attack gains a +\arabic{spellCost} bonus to hit and Damage. The spell must be cast at the same \glspl{ap} step as the arrow flies}% Description
  {
    The caster guides and enhnaces any attack at \spellRange\ -- usually an arrow -- granting a +\arabic{spellCost} bonus to hit and Damage.
    The caster must throw the spell while they hold exactly the same number of \glspl{ap} as whoever looses the arrow (or swings the sword).

    The caster cannot use this spell to attack directly, as they cannot attack at the same time as casting.
  }
