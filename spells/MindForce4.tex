  {The caster reads a book to an opening (hall, door or hatch), and it opens a portal from the caster to somewhere beyond \spellRange
  (the caster must be able to sense this area).
  The doorway has a +\arabic{spellPlusOne} Charisma Bonus, but no Intelligence.
  The portal can only move a total \gls{weight} of \arabic{spellTargets} before it closes itself or perishes}% Description
  {
  If another spell grants the portal sentience, it can slowly learn magical Spheres, and gain \glspl{mp}.
  Once it can store \arabic{spellCost}~\glspl{mp}, it can instinctively recast itself, which allows it to open itself, permitting travel.}
