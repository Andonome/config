  {The caster reads a book to an opening (hall, door or hatch), and it opens a portal to any place the caster has described in the reading.
  This magical portal remains silent, but can think, and will observe the place it makes a portal to, then make a portal to some other place it can see from there, and so on.

  The doorway has Intelligence and Charisma Bonuses at +2, and slowly learns the spheres used to cast it}% Description
  {
  While standard magical portals diminish in time, these doorways can store \glspl{mp} once they learn a single spell Sphere, and use it to keep themselves healthy.
  Of course moving a \gls{weight} of \arabic{spellTargets} or more through them in a single \gls{interval} destroys them as usual.}
