  {The caster cries a weirdly-specific doom, like `may your feet grow fungus', or `I hope your spells come out backwards', and the next \arabic{spellPlusTwo} times the target uses that Skill, they receive a -1 penalty}% Description
  {If used during combat, the curse can cancel an attack if it targets the Skill used to attack the caster.
  For example, if someone aims their bow at the caster, the caster might curse their Projectiles Skill; a miss would imply that they fumbled the arrow and dropped it, and then receive a penalty to their next \arabic{spellCost} rolls which employ Projectiles.}
