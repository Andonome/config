  {The caster focusses on a stone ceiling, and demands that it crack and splint in a precise pattern, to send a hunk of rock onto someone's head.
    If the target fails to notice the hunk of rock, they receive \showDam\ Damage}% Description
  {
    The ceiling generally remains intact, despite the small missing chunk, although repeated castings will inevitably bring down an entire floor of a castle, and \emph{might} cause a cave-in when underground.

    The spell can target ice as easily as any other type of solid material, but cannot target wood.
    Dense rock may give a penalty to the spell's \gls{tn}, at the \gls{gm}'s discretion.

    A failed roll generally indicates that the crack formed too slowly, and made too much noise, signaling to anyone below that rock might fall at any moment.
    Rolls with a high failure-margin might indicate that the rock failed to move entirely, and that anyone below the ceiling clearly understood that nothing could move or break it.
