  {The caster flat-out denies the existence of something the target is doing.
  As long as they continue the action, they receive a -\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Penalty to Mind \glspl{attribute} and a shadow forms between them and whatever they were focussed on, up to \spellRange\ away}% Description
  {%
    If the target was working on mending shoes, the shoes become enshadowed; if they wanted to loose an arrow at someone, a point between them and their target may become dim; and if they wanted to navigate out of a dense forest, the victim themself may find the shadows wrapping around them.

    The \gls{spell} vanishes once the target completes the task.
    Alternatively, the target may simply give up the task; in this case the \gls{spell} continues forever, but does nothing.
