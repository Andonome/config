  {The caster flat-out denies the existence of something the target is doing.
  The target then receives a -\arabic{spellPlusOne} Penalty to their current action, and whatever they were focussed on becomes enmeshed in shadow, inflicting a further -\arabic{spellPlusOne} Penalty to interacting with it}% Description
  {If the target was working on mending shoes, the shoes become enshadowed; if they wanted to loose an arrow at someone, a point between them and their target may become dim; and if they wanted to navigate out of a dense forest, the victim themself may find the shadows wrapping around them.

	Both targets must be within \spellRange\ of the caster.

	The shadow summoned is not very durable, and will only last \arabic{spellCost} \glspl{interval} once torchlight hits it.
	Sunlight will dissipate the shadow within \arabic{spellCost}~\glspl{round}.

  The spell will vanish once the target earns \arabic{spellCost}~\glspl{xp} for following their Code, or once the shadows are destroyed.
  Alternatively, the target may simply give up the task; in this case the shadows disappear once the target leaves, but will re-appear if they ever return.
