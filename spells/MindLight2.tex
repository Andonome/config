  {The caster flat-out denies the existence of something the target is doing.
  As long as they continue the action, they receive a -\arabic{spellPlusOne}~Penalty to Mind \glspl{attribute} and a shadow forms between them and whatever they were focussed on, up to \spellRange\ away}% Description
  {If the target was working on mending shoes, the shoes become enshadowed; if they wanted to loose an arrow at someone, a point between them and their target may become dim; and if they wanted to navigate out of a dense forest, the victim themself may find the shadows wrapping around them.

  The spell will vanish once the target completes that task.
  Alternatively, the target may simply give up the task; in this case the \gls{spell} continues forever, but does nothing}
