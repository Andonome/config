  {targets receive \rollConv~\glspl{fp}}% Description
  {
    The caster extends their best wishes to a crowd, and anyone \spellRange\ away but still listening gains \rollConv~\glspl{fp} (or at least up to \spellArea\ people).
    Noisier crowds can present a challenge, and raise the \gls{tn} significantly.
