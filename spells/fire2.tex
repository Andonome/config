  {target fire stops consuming a certain type of material}% Description
  {
    This spell changes the basic nature of a fire, so it can no longer burn a certain type of material.
    Casters generally use this to stop a fire damaging people, but it could just as easily be used to stop a fire spreading to clothing.

    The caster can target up to \spellArea\ steps.

    The fire will not stop feeding on whatever allows it to currently burn, so a wood fire will continue burning its wood.
