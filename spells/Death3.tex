  {current \glsentrytext{fatigue} penalty}% Resist with
  {Gain \gls{dr} 2, ignore up to \arabic{spelllevel}~\gls{fatigue} penalties, and see as the dead see}% Description
  {
    The target no longer sees normal light, but instead only the light of souls.
    However, the vision becomes indistinct beyond \spellRange\ -- the target understands nothing more than `something might live over there', and any life around them quickly distorts that limited vision.

    For as long as the spell remains active, the target cannot regenerate \glspl{fatigue}, \glspl{mp}, or \glspl{hp}.
