  {any spark blooms into a warm light}% Description
  {
    This light attaches to a target, hovering around them like sparkling oil-stain.
    The light springs up suddenly, and targets used to the dark, make a Wits + Vigilance test (\tn{9}) or loses \arabic{spelllevel}~\gls{ap}.

    The light fades if left in the darkness for a full \gls{interval}, or if batted and prodded for a couple of rounds.

  {A shadow forms a silhouette}% Description
  {
    One target shadow forms a detailed silhouette, and may even stand up and away from the ground.

    During the daylight, it simply appears very strange; but at night these shadow puppets can easily fool someone.

    \setcounter{track}{\value{spelllevel}}
    \addtocounter{track}{7}
    Onlookers in twilight must roll Wits + Vigilance, \tn{\arabic{track}}, to see through the illusion, and more darkness can increase the \gls{tn}.
  }
