  {a path appears, surrounded by clouds, which repels anything which might harm those who walk it (projectiles receive a minus \arabic{spelllevel} penalty, and other attacks receive minus \arabic{spelllevel} \glspl{ap}}% Description
  {
    The caster calls `make way, make safe', and the wind begins to form a path.
    Gusts of cloud begin to form, and soon settle, creating a comforting mist along the path.

    Anyone firing projectiles onto the misty path receives a minus \arabic{spelllevel} penalty due to lack of vision, and the same again due to the protective funnel of wind buffering the arrows back.
    The path begins \spellRange\ away, and covers about the same length from that point onwards.
