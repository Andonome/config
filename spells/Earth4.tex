  {during a snowstorm, the caster guides every snowflake to settle into a great ice-castle}% Description
  {
    The caster cries to every snowflake in a snowstorm, to settle and bind into ice.
    Brick by brick, they form a castle of ice, \spellArea\ wide and long.

    The castle only has shape, no doors, shutters, or anything more than halls and rooms.
    However, those halls always come covered in symbols, writing, or other elements from the caster's subconscious.
    The caster can give the dwelling any property they can realise within the limitations, and the spell's total potency enforces those ideas.
    A maze-like castle will add +\arabic{spelllevel} to the \gls{tn} to navigate it, while an impregnable castle will add a penalty to assault it.
