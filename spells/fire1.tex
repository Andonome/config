  {target fire flares, inflicting \arabic{spellPotency} Damage on all around}% Description
  {
    A fire-source roars, growing loud, aggressive, and large enough to damage anyone next to it.

    Someone carrying a candle would receive just \dmg{spelllevel} Damage, but those with a torch would receive more, and a target standing next to a bonfire could receive $1D6$ Damage.

    The caster can specify any target within one step of a fire.
    Anyone not taken by surprise can attempt to dodge, resisting with their Speed + Vigilance like any other missile weapon.
