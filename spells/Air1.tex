  {A small air-bubble surrounds the target as the caster whispers small oaths about reliability.
  The bubble protects them from foul gasses and allows them to go underwater}% Description
  {While mostly invisible, the bubble is real, and will go nowhere, resisting all but the strongest winds.

    Casters often use this to protect themselves from Noxious Fog spells.}

  {With a torrent of viscious swear-words, a pocket of foul air forms and inflicts \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{ep} to anyone who inhales it}% Description
  {
    The fog only covers \pgls{step} -- enough for a doorway, or small tunnel.
    It dissipates after a couple of \glspl{round}, or less if wind is present.
    Anyone can smell the fog and hold their breath when moving slowly, but anyone distracted or hurried must make a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll against 7 plus the caster's Bonus to notice the dangerous smell.

    Casting the spell outdoors raises the \gls{tn} to 9, casting it on a windy day raises it to 12, and casting the spell in a storm sets the \gls{tn} to~18.
