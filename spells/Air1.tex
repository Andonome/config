  {targets lose \arabic{spelllevel} \gls{ap} and get pushed back \arabic{spelllevel}~\glspl{ap} minus Strength}% Description
  {
    The mage blasts the target with chilled wind, draining them of \arabic{spelllevel} \gls{ap}.
    The wind pushes targets back \arabic{spelllevel} steps, minus their Strength Bonus.

\spell{Noxious Fog}% Name

  {Wane}% Action
  {Air}% Spheres
  {the wind speed}% Resist with
  {a pocket of foul air inflicts \arabic{spellPotency}~\glspl{fatigue} each round}% Description
  {
    The caster pollutes the air, making it stink, and caustic to breath.
    Anyone can attempt to hold their breath, but those not expecting the nauseating fumes suffer \arabic{spellPotency}~\glspl{fatigue}.

    The air only covers \arabic{spelllevel} square -- enough for a doorway, or small tunnel.
    It dissipates after a couple of turns, or less if wind is present.

    Casting the spell outdoors raises the \gls{tn} by 1, casting it on a windy day raises it by 3, and casting the spell in a storm raises the \gls{tn} by 5.

\spell{Bubble}% Name

  {Warp}% Action
  {Air}% Spheres
  {the density of the liquid}% Resist with
  {a small bubble surrounds the caster}% Description
  {
    A bubble, around 1 metre in diameter, gains a wobbly `shell', which holds it in place.
    While mostly invisible, the bubble is real, and will go nowhere, resisting all but the strongest winds.

    Casters often use this to protect themselves from Noxious Fog.
