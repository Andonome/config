  {the wind speed}% Resist with
  {A pocket of foul air inflicts \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{fatigue} each round}% Description
  {
    Anyone can attempt to hold their breath, but those not expecting the nauseating fumes suffer \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{fatigue}.

    The fog only covers \pgls{step} -- enough for a doorway, or small tunnel.
    It dissipates after a couple of turns, or less if wind is present.

    Casting the spell outdoors raises the \gls{tn} by 1, casting it on a windy day raises it by 3, and casting the spell in a storm raises the \gls{tn} by 5.

  {A small air-bubble surrounds the caster, protecting them from foul gasses and allowing them to go underwater}% Description

    While mostly invisible, the bubble is real, and will go nowhere, resisting all but the strongest winds.

    Casters often use this to protect themselves from Noxious Fog.
