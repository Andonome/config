  {A small air-bubble surrounds the caster, protecting them from foul gasses and allowing them to go underwater}% Description
  {While mostly invisible, the bubble is real, and will go nowhere, resisting all but the strongest winds.

    Casters often use this to protect themselves from Noxious Fog spells.}

  {A pocket of foul air inflicts \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{fatigue} each round, to anyone who inhales it}% Description

    The fog only covers \pgls{step} -- enough for a doorway, or small tunnel.
    It dissipates after a couple of turns, or less if wind is present.

    Casting the spell outdoors raises the \gls{tn} by 1, casting it on a windy day raises it by 3, and casting the spell in a storm raises the \gls{tn} by 5.
