  {A small air-bubble surrounds the target as the caster whispers small oaths about reliability.
  The bubble protects them from foul gasses and allows them to go underwater}% Description
  {While mostly invisible, the bubble is real, and will go nowhere, resisting all but the strongest winds.

    Casters often use this to protect themselves from Noxious Fog spells.}

  {With a torrent of viscious swear-words, a pocket of foul air forms and inflicts \arabic{spellPlusTwo}~\glspl{ep} to anyone who inhales it}% Description
  {
    The fog only covers \pgls{step} -- enough for a doorway, or small tunnel.
    It dissipates after a couple of turns, or less if wind is present.

    Casting the spell outdoors raises the \gls{tn} by 1, casting it on a windy day raises it by 3, and casting the spell in a storm raises the \gls{tn} by 5.
