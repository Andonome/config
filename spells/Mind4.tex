  	If the target might fail a roll, they must roll, because spiders now crawl around their peripheral vision.

	The \gls{spell} does not affect normal \glspl{action}, so the character can still climb a castle and fight, but may not be able to remove their shoes or search a room for `the table in the middle of the room'.
	\Glspl{action} which drunk people struggle with (writing, speaking politely, walking downhill) default to \tn[2].
	\Glspl{action} which drunk people don't usually struggle with (opening doors, dropping an item, drinking liquid) default to \tn[0].

	The \gls{spell} ends once the target goes home and completes their normal routine \arabic{spellPlusOne} days in a row.
