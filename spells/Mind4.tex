  {the target takes a -\arabic{spellCost} penalty to Mind Attributes when presented with a particular stimulus, and takes a -1 penalty to the next \arabic{spellCost} actions interacting with it}% Description
  {
    The caster shouts to the target about their imminent death (perhaps mentioning horses, long journeys, or poison slipped into their food).
    The target becomes intensely paranoid about that topic.

    The next \arabic{spellCost} rolls the target makes to interact with that stimulus receive a -1 penalty, and on top of that, all Mind Attributes take a -\arabic{spellCost} penalty when interacting with their new phobia.
