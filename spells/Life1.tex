  {The caster encourages the target to fight, and targets with a Strength Bonus below +2 gain a +1 Bonus, along with a monstrous appetite (which demands an extra meal every day), and a -\arabic{spellCost} Dexterity penalty}% Description
  {
  Smaller creatures stand to gain a lot more from the spell than larger ones, as it can make the final Strength Bonus half of the current score (rounded up), plus 1.
  Therefore, a tiny creature with a Strength Bonus of -5 would rise to -2 Strength, then finally to -1.

    The Dexterity penalty fades once targets become used to their new forms, although this can take some weeks.
    If the target ever fails to eat their required meals, they return to their normal state.
    This makes the spell rather dangerous for warriors, as people will often adjust their weapons and armour to their size, so a spell which wears off at the wrong time may leave them with all the wrong equipment.
    This spell is non-cumulative with others of the Life sphere.}
