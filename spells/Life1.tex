  {The caster encourages the target to fight, and the target gains a +\arabic{spellPlusOne} Strength Bonus.
  This stacks as usual, so the highest Bonus counts in full (their regular Bonus, or the spell's), and the lowest add only half.
  Each added Strength point demands an extra meal every day, and inflicts a -\arabic{spellPlusOne} Charisma Penalty due to ugly distortions (along with the loss of an equal number of maximum \glspl{fp}).
  Each point of \gls{dr} from armour inflicts 1~Damage}% Description
  {
    If the target ever fails to eat their required meals, they return to their normal state.
    This makes the spell rather dangerous for warriors, as people will often adjust their weapons and armour to their size, so a spell which wears off at the wrong time may leave them with all the wrong equipment.
    This spells stacks with other effects as usual, so using the Life Sphere to grant a +3 Bonus, then a +2 Bonus, on top of a natural Strength Bonus of +2 would grant a +5 total Bonus.}
