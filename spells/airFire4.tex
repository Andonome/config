    As the caster calls to fire spirits, fires in the area flare up like dragons' breath, burning anyone nearby.
    Shadowy spirits, born of the foul air from the dead fires, cover the caster's enemies.

    Anyone neary a fire takes \showDam\ Damage.
    Anyone who breathes in receives \arabic{spellCost} \glspl{fatigue}.

    The shadowy spirits of noxious air will follow all targets, wth an effective Speed Bonus of \arabic{spellCost}.
