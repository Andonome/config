  {\spellArea\ targets lose \arabic{spelllevel} \glspl{ap} while lightning hits them for \arabic{spelllevel} Damage}% Description
  {
    During any \gls{interval} where lightning flashes, the caster can seize the ambient fire in the air, and channel it into a powerful blast of lightning and wind.

    The resulting boom inflicts \dmg{spelllevel} Damage on \spellArea\ targets, and reduce their \glspl{ap} by \arabic{spelllevel}.
    Armour does nothing to shield the targets -- the lightning finds a way through.

    Casters should ensure they have enough targets before starting this spell, or it will target them and their companions.
    The range of \spellRange\ can also present a problem, as the first target must be close, and subsequent targets must be within \spellRange\ of another for the storm to pass through them.
