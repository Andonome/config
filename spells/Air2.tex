  {The caster feels for any conspicuous absence of mana in the wind, cause by another spellcaster regaining \glspl{mp}.
  The \glsentrytext{tn} is 12, but reduces by~1 for each \gls{mp} a nearby caster is missing}% Description
  {If \pgls{dryad} in the \gls{area} had spend 5~\glspl{mp}, the caster would roll against \tn[7], while detecting \pgls{witch} with only 1 missing \gls{mp} would be \tn[11].

  While the range is not far, detecting the direction of the \emph{absence} of \glspl{mp} means the caster knows which direction to walk to find (or flee) whatever needs to such up all the local \glspl{mp}.
  The caster can guess up to four directions which the mana-vacuum may be coming from, and receive a `yes' from the most correct direction.
  Casters mostly pick `North, East, South and West' for the first spell, then try to narrow down the potential direction of the mana-starved creature with a second casting, where the four directions all point in a similar direction.

  This spell poses a serious danger to all spell-casters, as many ancient and paranoid creatures use it to hunt and kill spell-casters.

  Multiple casters who lack \glspl{mp} do not stack -- five gnomes who each need 2~\glspl{mp} just means a vacuum of 2~\glspl{mp}.}
