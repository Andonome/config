  Segments never assume the results of a previous segment; so if one segment introduces a violent \glsentrytext{witch} to the \glspl{pc}, later scenes should not assume that the troupe have not killed the \glsentrytext{witch}.

  And, of course, segments can comfortably split apart.

    However, swarms only take 1 Damage each per attack.

    Swarms can split into smaller parts as a normal movement action.
    Each part inflicts 1~Damage each \glsentrytext{round} to anyone on the same \gls{step}, as long as the swarm's \glsentrytext{hp} total comes to more than the target's \glsentrytext{covering}},
