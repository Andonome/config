\chapter{How to Make Monsters}

\section{Introduction}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{All about Dragons}

\begin{boxtext}

As you embark upon your first adventure, you summon your first monster with a simple backstroke.
You write down {\tt\textbackslash dragon}, and behold!

\end{boxtext}

\dragon

Each time you conjure the dragon, it will look a little different.
The next one might look like this:

\dragon

If you find it hard to tell the difference between all the dragons, you can give them names in square brackets with the {\tt\textbackslash NPC command}, like this:

{\tt\textbackslash dragon[\textbackslash npc\{\textbackslash M\}\{Bob the dragon\}] }

Which then makes a male dragon called ``Bob'':

\dragon[\npc{\M}{Bob the Dragon}]

The first field can also indicate a female with an {\tt\textbackslash F} (\F), a team of people with a {\tt\textbackslash T} (\T), or undead with \textbackslash D (\D).

With a little study, you can summon dozens of monsters, including {\tt\textbackslash humansoldier}, {\tt\textbackslash basilisk}, and {\tt \textbackslash ghoul}.

\subsection{Individual NPCs}

Individual characters can be created by using the {\tt\textbackslash npc} command then the \textbackslash person command, with its nine arguments:

\begin{verbatim}

\npc{\M}{Alice}

\person{0}% STRENGTH
{1}% DEXTERITY 
{-1}% SPEED
{{2}% INTELLIGENCE
{0}% WITS
{0}}% CHARISMA
{0}% DR
{1}% COMBAT
{Academics 1, Wyldcrafting 1}% SKILLS
{\longsword, adventuring equipment}% EQUIPMENT
{}

\end{verbatim}

\npc{\M}{Alice}
\person{0}% STRENGTH
{1}% DEXTERITY 
{-1}% SPEED
{{2}% INTELLIGENCE
{0}% WITS
{0}}% CHARISMA
{0}% DR
{1}% COMBAT
{Academics 1, Wyldcrafting 1}% SKILLS
{\longsword, adventuring equipment}% EQUIPMENT
{}

You can add things for these people to say with a {\tt\textbackslash begin\{speechtext\}} command:

\begin{speechtext}

  ``Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?''

  ``That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.''

\end{speechtext}

\subsection{And now for something completely different}

This is a magical item.

\begin{verbatim}

\magicitem{Noodle of Death}% NAME
  {Extinguish}% SPELL
  {Divinity (FSM)}% PATH
  {Instant}% DURATION
  {Pocket Spell}% TYPE
  {2}% Potency
  {5}% MP

\end{verbatim}

\magicitem{Noodle of Death}% NAME
  {Extinguish}% SPELL
  {Divinity (FSM)}% PATH
  {Instant}% DURATION
  {Pocket Spell}% TYPE
  {2}% Potency
  {5}% MP

\subsection{Encounters}

Make encounter tables like this:

\begin{verbatim}

  \begin{encounters}{Wonderland}

    Fields & Gardens & Results \\\hline

    \li & Doormouse \\
    \li & Dodo \\
    \li \lii Unicorn \\
    \li \lii Red Queen \\
    & \lii Black Queen \\
    & \lii Green Queen \\

\end{verbatim}

\begin{encounters}{Wonderland}

  Fields & Gardens & Results \\\hline

  \li & Doormouse \\
  \li & Dodo \\
  \li \lii Unicorn \\
  \li \lii Red Queen \\
  & \lii Black Queen \\
  & \lii Green Queen \\


\end{encounters}

And charts about roll successes like this:

\begin{verbatim}


  \begin{rollchart}

    Roll & Result \\\hline

    12 & Success \\

    11 & Failure \\

  \end{rollchart}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{rollchart}

  Roll & Result \\\hline

  12 & Success \\

  11 & Failure \\

\end{rollchart}

\end{multicols}

\section{Weapon Commands}

The {\tt\textbackslash weapon{Name}{1}{2}{3}{80}} command works in 2 ways.
When defining a weapon, it adjusts the current creature's stats.
When used in a weapons chart, it shows the weapon's stats.

Stats are derives from the weapon's 3 properties: length, sharpness, and weight.

\begin{verbatim}
  \weapon{Sword}% NAME
    {2}% LENGTH
    {1}% SHARPNESS
    {1}% WEIGHT
    {400}% COST
\end{verbatim}

The attack bonus comes from the weapon's length.
The damage comes from the weapon's sharpness or weight (whichever is higher).
The initiative cost to swing the weapon comes from its weight as well.
Finally, the weight is the same as the minimum Strength bonus required to wield the weapon properly.

When that weapon command appears in a table, it shows the Attack, Damage, and Minimum Strength required to lift it.
When when a creature wields the weapon, those stats raise the creature's stats.

  \begin{nametable}[XXXXXX]{M\^{e}l\'{e}e Weapons}

  \textbf{Standard Weapons} & \textbf{Bonus} & \textbf{Dam.} & \textbf{Initiative} & \textbf{Min. Str.} & Cost \\\hline

  \Dagger

  \greataxe

  \spear

  \quarterstaff

  \end{nametable}
